I am a program specific researcher in the Hiraoka group at the Advanced Study of Human Biology institute (ASHBi) in Kyoto University. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay and INRIA Saclay, under the supervision of Gilles Blanchard and Clément Levrard. I defended my thesis in September 2023.
My research interests involve topological data analysis, machine learning and applications to all sorts of biological data.
