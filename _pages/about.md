I am a PhD student (2020-2023) at the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay and INRIA Saclay, under the supervision of Gilles Blanchard and Clément Levrard. My defense is expected to take place in September 2023. Prior to that, I was a student at the ENS Paris-Saclay (2016-2020) and graduated from the MVA master program in 2019.
My research interests lie at the crossroads between topological data analysis and machine learning. While my PhD thesis had an emphasis on the theoretical aspects of statistical learning, I am keen on applications especially in medicine, ecology and climate sciences.
