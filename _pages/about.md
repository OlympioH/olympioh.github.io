I am a JSPS Postdoc fellow in the Hiraoka group at the Advanced Study of Human Biology institute (ASHBi) in Kyoto University. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay and INRIA Saclay, under the supervision of Gilles Blanchard and Clément Levrard. I defended my thesis in September 2023.
My research interests lie at the crossroads between topological data analysis and machine learning. While my PhD thesis had an emphasis on the theoretical aspects of statistical learning, I am keen on applications especially in medicine, ecology and climate sciences.
